A simple Turing Machine implementation aimed at simulating the machines in Turing's 1936 paper, 
as I read along in [The Annotated Turing](http://www.theannotatedturing.com),
perpetually very much under construction. 

To play with the latest semi-stable version, [launch the demo notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/orome/automata-py.git/master/?urlpath=lab/tree/demo.ipynb) in Binder.
